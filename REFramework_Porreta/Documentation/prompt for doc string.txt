I want you to create a doc string for my workflow in UiPath Studio based in the xaml code I will pass.


Use the following docstring structure:

"""
# Purpose
This workflow is responsible for ...

# Input Arguments
- in_arg1 (InArgument<String>)
argument description

- in_arg2 (InArgument<Dictionary<String, String>>)
 argument 2 description 


# Output Arguments
- out_arg1(OutArgument<String>)
Final HTML content after performing all replacements.

# Workflow Structure
Use 2 to 3 sentences to describe how the workflow is implemented


# Error Handling
Describe throws used in the workflow
"""



This is the xaml file I would like to be documented:
"""
{XAML_CODE}
"""
